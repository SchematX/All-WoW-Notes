### Torghast, Tower Of The Damned
One of the first things that World of Warcraft: Shadowlands players will want to do after hitting Level 60 is to grab the introductory quest-line for Torghast and the Runecarver. The first quest can be found in Orbis, takes place in The Maw, and revolves around Broker Ve'nari. After completing the quest, players will unlock access to Torghast, the Tower of Torment, across their entire account. Torghast is a brand new World of Warcraft game-mode: a multi-floor, randomly-generated dungeon that spawns new enemies and objectives with each run. Players will mostly be interested in running Torghast to gain a currency called Soul Ash, which is required to imbue armor with Shadowland's Legendary Powers.


Players can enter Torghast as many times as they like, but will only gain power progression rewards from each layer once per week. There are six wings in Torghast, plus the Twisting Corridors, an endless mode that allows players to grind cosmetic items. Only two of the six wings will be open each week. Along the way Shadowlands players will earn Anima, which can be used at certain layers to grant new powers for the rest of the run.
### The Runecarver
A mysterious figure chained in the heart of Torghast, the Runecarver is a unique NPC with the ability to imbue armor with Legendary Powers. To do this, he requires Soul Ash earned in the Torghast wings. This is handy, as unlocking the Runecarver after hitting Level 60 is connected to the Torghast quest-line. Once players have completed Deep Within, Ashes of the Tower, and The Final Pieces, they will be able to freely access the Runecarver's abilities.
### Soulbinds And Conduits
As new level 60 World of Warcraft players progress through the introductory questline, they'll also unlock the Soulbinding ability. This unique Shadowlands power allows a player to bind their soul to one of 12 possible Soulbind Paths, each tied to a specific Covenant member. After picking a Covenant, players will have access to the 3 Soulbind Paths within it, though they will only be able to use one at a time.
### Dungeons, World Bosses, And Weekly Quests
As well as the new features, there are also some classic World of Warcraft endgame activities in the Shadowlands. Players exploring the map will be able to take on the 4 rotating world bosses, earning themselves high-tier loot, Conduits, and Legendary Power recipes. In addition, there are two weekly dungeon quests available from Ta'lan the Antiquary in Oribos, as well as two weekly PvP quests that can be picked up from the Oribos' Enclave area.
