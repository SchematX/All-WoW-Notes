# World of Warcraft: Shadowlands - How to Get the Silverwind Larion Secret Mount

World of Warcraft: Shadowlands has a secret mount, the Silvermane Larion, that can be earned while wandering the unsettling afterlife in Bastion.

_**World of Warcraft**_ has had a variety of mounts for players over the years. While some have been earned with massive, in-game efforts, some have been free for all players, like the free [player-selected Wandering Ancient mount in  _Shadowlands_](https://gamerant.com/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-free-mount/). But players looking to get the Silverwind Larion have put forth monumental effort in order to earn one of these coveted mounts.

## Silverwind Larion

The Silverwind Larion is a winged lion cat whose blue fur and feathers are fading to white. This armored mount increases flight speed by 310%/280%/150%, and it increases ground speed by 100%. The mount's flavor text reads: "_This gift of the silvery winds is only bestowed upon those that search high and low for the wisdom of Bastion._" But where players could find the Wisdom of  [_World of Warcraft: Shadowland_'s unsettling city of Bastion](https://gamerant.com/world-warcraft-shadowlands-bastion-kyrian-ascension-forsworn-odd/)  has been a mystery, until recently.

## How To Get The Mount

Players can earn this beautiful Bastion mount by collecting 50 Anima shards, which are scattered around the zone. Sounds easy, but there is a catch: these Anima shards are tiny and hidden. But players can usually find a few of them just while wandering around the zone, trying to figure out exactly  [what Bastion is](https://gamerant.com/world-warcraft-shadowlands-afterlives-bastion/).

## Locations Of The 50 Anima Shards

As stated above, players need to find all 50 out of 50 Anima shards. These small, glowing blue stones were laid in a pattern across the map, giving players who noted both their locations and quest IDs. Although there are  [some things that make no sense in the world of Shadowlands](https://www.thegamer.com/world-warcraft-shadowlands-makes-no-sense/), this one seemed to be laid out in a way that made finding all 50 a little easier. And thankfully, a user named Zarillion who manages the  _HandyNotes: Shadowlands_  addon, has compiled all the Shard information into a map to make it even easier.

Here are the locations of the first 44 shards in  _[World of Warcraft](https://gamerant.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/): Shadowlands_, connected on this map in order of quest number. The final six are:

-   The first of the six was found on Aspirantâ€™s Rest, on top of the main structure.
-   The second was in the hills northeast of Necrotic Wake.
-   The third was by the Path of Wisdom.
-   The fourth was found in Kraznir's Exchange.
-   The fifth is located in the Necrotic Wake dungeon
-   The final shard is located here:

Keep in mind that only players that have  [reached the new level cap, Level 60, in  _World of Warcraft: Shadowlands_](https://gamerant.com/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-world-first-level-60-monkeylool/)  can even see the Anima Shards, much less collect them. If players can't seem to find a single shard, they may just need to finish leveling their character to max before continuing. If players need a few more details on finding one of more of the shards, check out this in-depth video on how to get all 50 and collect the Silvermane Larion:
